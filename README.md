The song is a small song by a small group that we happened to fall across and we thought the song was funny but also meanfully. So as soon as we heard it we knew that this song would be perfect for us.

# How you interpreted it's mood and structure

We interpreted by 

# What inspired you to create the visual elements you designed

We listen to the song and thought it was a goofy song and thought it would be a good choice for us to use for our assignment. We thought about the lyrics of the song and realised that the song was about an music group with dreams but have no money. So we thought we could make something out of the ordinary and that's when we came up with the idea, a spaceship. terrain, the sun and an endless loop as far as the eye can see. Kinda like representing thier dreams in a way.

# What We're am most proud of in the assignment

We are pround of the overall assignment in general, we thought we did a really good job with just the two of us. The overall landscape to the spaceship we are very proud of are assignment overall.
